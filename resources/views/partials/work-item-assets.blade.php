{{-- Everything the <wi-list> work item grid needs, in the one order that works.

     THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. The skin's group rule and Tabulator's base theme collide at
     equal specificity:

         ours       .wi-grid .tabulator-group          (0,2,0)
         Tabulator  .tabulator-row.tabulator-group     (0,2,0)   background: #ccc

     At equal specificity the later stylesheet wins, so work-items.css must come AFTER
     tabulator.min.css. Loading them the other way round turns every collapsed group row grey
     — which is exactly what happened when the Cycles screen listed these tags for itself.

     Hence a partial rather than a copy per page: the list is one component, so its assets are
     one block, and a page that mounts <wi-list> cannot get the order wrong.

     Include AFTER assets/css/styles.css and assets/js/settings/app.js, and BEFORE the screen
     script that mounts the component — deferred scripts run in document order, so that leaves
     PB.boot and WiList both defined by the time the screen script runs. --}}

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ pb_asset('assets/vendor/tabulator/tabulator.min.css') }}" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ pb_asset('assets/css/tabulator-skin.css') }}" />
<script src="{{ pb_asset('assets/vendor/tabulator/tabulator.min.js') }}"></script>

{{-- The row vocabulary (state/priority icons, chips, avatars) and the shared date picker.
     Its own partial because the Views grid reuses exactly these and nothing else here — and
     it loads work-items.css, which has to come after tabulator.min.css above. --}}
@include('partials.work-item-chips')

{{-- The <wi-list> grid itself. --}}
<script defer src="{{ pb_asset('assets/js/projects/work-item-list.js') }}"></script>

{{-- The drawer's rich-text boxes — description, comment, reply and status update — all mount
     <wk-editor> (Lexical) with `minimal`. Here rather than on each screen for the same reason
     the grid's assets are: the set has a load order, and one page getting it wrong is a screen
     with no editor.

     `rich-editor` still comes with it: <wi-editor> (Quill) is defined in work-items.js and
     other screens mount it, and Tribute is loaded there too. Neither is used by the drawer any
     more. --}}
