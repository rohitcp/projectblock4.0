  {{-- Space Settings (docs/features/help-center.md, P11).

       Three columns: the Help Center's own navigation on the far left (from the shared layout),
       this Space's Settings navigation next to it, and the selected page on the right — the
       shape Project Settings uses, and the classes are lifted from it rather than reinvented so
       the two screens cannot drift apart.

       It deliberately keeps the Space's toolbar and section tabs above all three. Project
       Settings is a full-screen detour out of the project, with its own document and its own
       way back; a Space's Settings is a SECTION of the Space, sitting beside Overview and Inbox.
       Dropping the tabs here would mean leaving the Space to configure
       it, and needing a "back" affordance to undo that. --}}

  {{-- `flex-1` so this row takes the height left over below the toolbar and the tabs, which is
       what lets the sidebar's border run to the bottom of the window on a SHORT page (P55).
       `items-start` keeps the PAGE top-aligned; the aside opts out with `self-stretch`.

       `min-h-0` is deliberately NOT here any more (P76).

       It was, and it capped this row at the leftover VIEWPORT height: a flex item with
       `min-height: 0` may shrink below its own content, so on a long Settings page — Company &
       Customer with three cards, two field tables and a mapping table — the row stayed one
       screen tall while its content spilled past it. The aside stretched to the row, so the
       sidebar and its right-hand border stopped at the fold and left a white gap under it for
       the rest of the scroll.

       Without it the row's min-height is `auto`, meaning its content, and `flex-1` still grows
       it to fill a short page. Height becomes max(leftover, content) — which is both halves of
       what the sidebar needs, with no pixel value to go stale when a section is added. --}}
  <div class="flex items-start flex-1">
    {{-- The Settings sidebar. w-60, px-2, h-8 rows, `bg-sel text-brand font-medium` when
         active — the same treatment projects/settings/layout.blade.php gives its nav, because
         "which settings page am I on" should look the same wherever you are.

         TWO elements doing two jobs (P79), not one doing both badly:

         The `aside` still stretches to the full content height (P76), which is what draws the
         column and its right-hand border all the way down. It is the BACKGROUND.

         The `div` inside it is `sticky top-0` and is the MENU. Making the aside itself sticky
         would not work: it is as tall as the content (1629px on this page), and a sticky element
         taller than the scrollport has nowhere to stick — it just scrolls. So the tall thing
         stays put and the short thing sticks inside it.

         `top-0` is the top of the SCROLL CONTAINER, not of the window — the toolbar and the
         Space tabs live inside that container and scroll away above it, which is what makes the
         menu sit directly under the topbar once you have scrolled.

         `max-h-screen overflow-y-auto` is a safety net, not the normal case: thirteen 32px rows
         plus the header is about 480px against an 840px scrollport, so it never engages today.
         It engages the day somebody adds enough settings sections to outgrow the window, and
         without it those last few would be unreachable. --}}

         `pb-[200px]` is scroll room under the last card (P76). Every panel ends its own content
         with `py-10`, which puts the final section 40px off the bottom of the window — close
         enough that a Save button at the end of a long form reads as clipped, and short enough
         that there is nowhere to scroll to confirm it is not.

         On the CONTAINER rather than inside each panel: there are ten panel kinds and the JS
         builds each one's padding separately, so ten copies of the same value is ten places for
         it to drift. It also grows the row, which is what the sidebar stretches to — so the
