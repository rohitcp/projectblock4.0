/**
 * "You've been assigned {IDENTIFIER}" — sent when someone becomes a work item's assignee.
 *
 * Queued (CLAUDE.md §11): assigning is an inline chip edit and must return immediately.
 * Everything is passed as a scalar, not as an Eloquent model, because a queued mailable is
 * rebuilt by a worker with no tenancy context, where a tenant-scoped work item would not
 * resolve.
 *
 * This is deliberately mail-only for now. When the Phase 1 notification stack (database +
 * broadcast + Reverb bell, CLAUDE.md §8/§9) lands, this becomes the mail channel of a
 * Notification rather than a standalone Mailable.
