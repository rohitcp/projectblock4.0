/**
 * "{IDENTIFIER} moved to {STATE}" — sent to everyone subscribed to a work item when its state
 * changes (docs/features/work-item-toolbar.md).
 *
 * Queued (CLAUDE.md §11): a state change is an inline chip edit and must return immediately —
 * with ten subscribers, sending inline would put ten SMTP round-trips in front of the click.
 *
 * Everything is a scalar, not an Eloquent model, for the same reason WorkItemAssignedMail does
 * it: a queued mailable is rebuilt by a worker with no tenancy context, where a tenant-scoped
 * work item would not resolve.
 *
 * `$url` is the item's own page, which is the whole point of subscribing — the mail says what
 * moved and takes you straight back to it.
