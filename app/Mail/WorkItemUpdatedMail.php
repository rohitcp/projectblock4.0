 * "{Title} ({ID}) — updated" — sent when a work item's properties change.
 *
 * ONE email per update, listing every field that moved, rather than one per field: a single
 * edit can change status, assignee and due date together, and three emails about one action is
 * how people learn to filter this address away.
 *
 * Queued (CLAUDE.md §11), and everything is a scalar: a queued mailable is rebuilt by a worker
 * with no tenancy context, where a tenant-scoped work item would not resolve.
