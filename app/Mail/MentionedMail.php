/**
 * "{ACTOR} mentioned you" — sent when someone names you in a description or a comment.
 *
 * Stands in for the Inbox until it exists (mentions §19): the same information, delivered the
 * one way this application can deliver it today. §31 asks that the notification architecture
 * not be coupled to the editor, and it is not — this reads the `mentions` records, so when the
 * Inbox lands it reads the same rows and this becomes one channel of a Notification.
 *
 * Scalars only, like every other mailable here: a queued one is rebuilt by a worker with no
 * tenancy context, where a tenant-scoped model would not resolve. Sent immediately by product
 * decision — see WorkItemStatusNotifier for that trade.
