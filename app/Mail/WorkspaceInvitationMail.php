 *
 * Queued per CLAUDE.md §11 — sending must not sit inside the invite request. Everything it
 * needs is passed as a scalar rather than as an Eloquent model: a queued mailable is
 * serialized and rebuilt by a worker that has no tenancy context, and re-resolving a
 * tenant-scoped invitation there would come back empty.
 *
 * `$acceptUrl` embeds the raw invitation token, which exists nowhere else (only its hash is
 * stored), so this object must never be logged.
