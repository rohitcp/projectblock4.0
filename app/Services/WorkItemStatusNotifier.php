/**
 * Tells a work item's subscribers that its status moved (CLAUDE.md §9).
 *
 * Built on the same three rules as WorkItemAssignmentNotifier, because they are what make an
 * alert worth reading rather than something people filter away:
 *
 *  - **Only subscribers.** Not assignees, not the project — the person asked for this item.
 *  - **Never the person who did it.** You do not need telling what you just clicked.
 *  - **After commit, sent immediately, and never fatal.** The state change happens inside the
 *    updater's transaction: if that rolls back, the status never moved and the mail must not
 *    go out. A mail server being down must not fail somebody's edit, so failures are logged.
 *
 * DELIVERY IS IMMEDIATE (`sendNow`), by product decision, and this is a deliberate departure
 * from CLAUDE.md §11's "queue email notifications". Queueing means the alert waits for a
 * worker — and on any box where nobody is running `queue:work`, it never arrives at all. The
 * cost is real and worth knowing: the request that changed the status pays for one SMTP
 * round-trip per subscriber before it returns. If that ever becomes the slow part of a chip
 * click, the fix is a real queue plus a worker, not a smaller recipient list.
 *
 * Each subscriber is checked against WorkItemPolicy@view before being written to. Subscribing
 * is not a permanent grant: someone removed from a project keeps their subscription row, and
 * without this check they would keep receiving that project's work by email (requirements §7).
