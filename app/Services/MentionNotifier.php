/**
 * Tells people they were named (mentions §15, §19, §20).
 *
 * Takes the list MentionSync produced — people NEWLY mentioned in this piece of content — and
 * applies the one rule that is about notification rather than about the record:
 *
 *  §15 — **you are never told you mentioned yourself.** The mention is still recorded, because
 *  the content genuinely names you and the Inbox will want to render it; the email is what
 *  would be absurd.
 *
 * Everything else — deduplication (§14), only-new-on-edit (§11/§12), permission (§16/§24) — is
 * already settled by the time the list arrives here. This class does delivery and nothing else,
 * which is what §31 asks for: the notification path must not be coupled to the editor.
 *
 * Sent after commit and never fatally: a mention is written inside the transaction that saves
 * the comment or the work item, and a mail server being down must not fail somebody's edit.
