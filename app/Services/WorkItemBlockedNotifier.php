/**
 * Tells the people responsible for a work item that it has just become blocked
 * (Collaboration spec §58).
 *
 * WHO IS TOLD: the project's lead (its owner) and the work item's assignee. Those are the two
 * people who have to do something about a blocker — the lead because they own delivery, the
 * assignee because it is their work that has stopped. Duplicates are collapsed, and whoever
 * created the dependency is not mailed about their own action.
 *
 * WHEN: only when a `blocking` row is created, and only for the item on the receiving end —
 * the item doing the blocking has not changed state as far as its owner is concerned.
 *
 * Registered with `DB::afterCommit`, because relations are written inside a transaction: if
 * it rolls back, nothing is blocked and no mail should claim otherwise.
 *
 * Sent IMMEDIATELY (`sendNow`) rather than queued, by product decision — a departure from
 * CLAUDE.md §11, taken for every work item alert together. Queued, the mail waits for a
 * worker and never arrives where none is running; not queued, the request that created the
 * dependency waits for the SMTP round-trip.
