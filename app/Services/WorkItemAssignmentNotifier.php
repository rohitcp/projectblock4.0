/**
 * Tells someone they were given a work item (§4.3 / CLAUDE.md §9).
 *
 * Two rules keep the mail meaningful rather than noisy:
 *  - only the *newly* assigned user is told, not whoever was assigned before;
 *  - assigning something to yourself sends nothing — you already know.
 *
 * Sending is registered with `DB::afterCommit`, because assignment happens inside the
 * updater's transaction: if that transaction rolls back, the assignment never happened and
 * the mail must not go out. Delivery problems are logged, never thrown — a mail server being
 * down must not fail the edit that triggered it.
 *
 * Sent IMMEDIATELY (`sendNow`) rather than queued, by product decision — a departure from
 * CLAUDE.md §11. Queued, the mail waits for a worker and never arrives at all where none is
 * running; the price of not queueing is that the assigning request waits for the SMTP
 * round-trip.
