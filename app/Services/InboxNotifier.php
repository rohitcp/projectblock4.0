 *
 *  §4.1 — never a second unread entry for the same assignment.
 *  §15  — never for something you did to yourself.
 *  §28  — unassigning removes the unread entry it created; there is no value in asking
 *         somebody to review an assignment that no longer exists.
 *  §29  — reassigning is those two rules together: the old assignee's unread entry goes, the
 *         new one gets theirs.
 *  §19  — deleting a comment removes the unread mentions that pointed into it.
 *
 * Read entries are never touched by any of this. Once somebody has seen a notification, it is
 * a thing that happened to them; §29 says so explicitly.
