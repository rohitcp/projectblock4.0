/**
 * Project Workspace → Cycles (Cycles §4-§10).
 *
 * The screen works like Work Items: one Vue root and one payload for both the list and a
 * single cycle, with `pageCycleId` telling the client to render the detail instead of the
 * landing page — so a cycle URL is real and linkable rather than a list with a panel over it.
 *
 * Every action starts from CyclePolicy, which refuses outright when Cycles is switched off
 * for the project (§3.2.4). Cross-project ids 404 rather than 403, so a response never
 * confirms that a cycle exists somewhere the user cannot see.
