/**
 * The work item detail toolbar's vote and subscribe controls (POC html/work-items.html).
 *
 * Both are gated on **viewing** the item, not on editing it: voting on a proposal and asking
 * to hear about it are things a Viewer or a Commenter has every reason to do, and neither
 * changes the work item. `WorkItemPolicy@view` already refuses an item in a project the
 * caller cannot open, and 404s rather than 403s so a refusal never confirms it exists.
 *
 * Both endpoints TOGGLE, and both answer with the whole resulting state rather than "ok" —
 * the toolbar paints from the response instead of guessing what its click did, so two tabs
 * open on the same item cannot disagree about the count.
