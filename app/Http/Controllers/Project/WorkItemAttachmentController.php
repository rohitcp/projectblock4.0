/**

 * detail action row, which shipped inert as "coming soon" until this.
 *
 * Files are stored PRIVATE and streamed through `show()` behind the project's `viewAny` ability,
 * the same shape WorkItemMediaController uses and for the same reason (CLAUDE.md §7): a file on
 * the public disk is a URL that works for anyone who receives it, regardless of workspace.
 *
 * Refusals are 404 rather than 403 throughout, so a response never confirms that a file exists
 * somewhere the caller cannot reach (§12).
