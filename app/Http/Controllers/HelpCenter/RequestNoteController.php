 * Its own controller rather than four more methods on `RequestController`, for one reason worth
 * stating plainly: **nothing in this file can send a customer an email.** There is no mailer
 * pointed at `customer_email` here, no Reply-To, no message row. The only mail it sends goes to
 * a colleague who was named, at their own address.
 *
 * That is the requirement's central rule — "Internal Notes must never be visible to the customer
 * and must never be included in customer-facing email threads" — expressed as structure rather
